# Julia Set Renderer

This is an application for rendering 3d mathmatical patterns.
It can either render a 3d Julia Set using voxels or a signed distance function.

Several other feature incldue an editable skybox for lighting and procedural textures using nodes.






Currently, the only signed distance function available is a mandelbulb but the plan is to add an option to create funcitons dynamically.
